By popular demand, the new name is Draw On Gnome. The old github link (DrawOnYourScreen3) should redirect to the new one: https://github.com/daveprowse/Draw-On-Gnome.</li> <li>Restarted version numbering at 1.0 and dropped a new release.</li> <li>Rebuilt, tested and pushed the installer bash script.</li> <li>Fixed and rebuilt translations.</li> <li>I tested with GitHub Organizations. I tried two different imports and it failed both times. As such, I am not getting a pleasant feeling about organizations so far, so I am going to step away from that idea for now.</li> <li>Currently working on fixing code so E.G.O. can approve the extension. It's been a tough go. Fix one thing and it breaks another. Unfortunately, the code requires a lot of changes to meet GNOME GJS standards. Working on it and testing as I go to make sure everything is functional with each change. I may be posting issues and requesting help with some of the JavaScript work!</li> </ul>"}]}
