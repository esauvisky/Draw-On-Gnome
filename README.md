## Installation Methods for GNOME v47 and v46

> Note: We are working on getting the extension approved by GNOME so that it will be listed on https://extensions.gnome.org (E.G.O.) - Stay tuned!

### Option 1: Use the Automated Script

Copy the following command to your Bash terminal and press `enter` to run it:

```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveprowse/scripts/refs/heads/main/doys-install.sh)
```

> **IMPORTANT!!** Always check scripts before running them! If you are uncomfortable running the script, or cannot run the script, then install manually with [Option #2](#option-2-install-manually-from-the-release-or-repository-branch) below.

The script will identify your version of GNOME (if it is between v42 and v47) and install the correct version of the extension automatically.

When complete, logout and log back in 

Then enable the extension:

- In the CLI:

  ```console
  gnome-extensions enable draw-on-your-screen3@daveprowse.github.io
  ```

- In the GUI
  - Open the GNOME Extensions App:

      `gnome-extensions-app`

  - Locate Draw On Your Screen 3 and enable it.

   > Note: You can install the Gnome Extensions App with the package `gnome-shell-extensions-prefs` within your Linux distribution.

Now go forth and use the tool by pressing `Super + Alt + D`.

> Note: You can discover the keyboard shortcuts by pressing `Ctrl + F1`.

It's back to the drawing board my friends!

### Option 2: Install Manually from the Release or Repository Branch

> Note: For GNOME versions other than 47 & 46, see [Other GNOME Versions](#other-gnome-versions) below.
